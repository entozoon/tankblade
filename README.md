_"Ghouls! Frickin ghouls everywhere, just my luck!<br>
Well, I best hop in this here spinning-top, blade-encrusted tank and start slashy smashin'."_

## [PLAY THE GAME!](https://entozoon.itch.io/tankblade)

### ​Development

This game was built entirely by myself from scratch for [LOWREZJAM 2019​](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2019) in a week, including all music, physics, graphics\* etc and is completely open source​!

This is my very first Game Jam submission and was a brilliant challenge - to build a game with a true resolution of 64x64 - forcing my coding to improve and encouraging a fast-and-loose development style fitting with a jam so as to, you know, _actually complete_ a side-project for once!

\* The renderer itself is [Pixi.js​](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) (a library underneath Phaser), which I can't claim to have built ^\_-

## Dev

    npm i
    npm start

## Deploy (for personal reference, not you guys)

Deployed to [itch.io](https://entozoon.itch.io/tankblade) using [Butler](https://fasterthanlime.itch.io/butler) which is to be downloaded into `/_butler`, then by whamming a cheeky little:

    npm run prepreitch
    npm run itch
